# How to localize PivotGridControl via the PivotGridLocalizer class


<p>The following example shows how to localize PivotGridControl via the PivotGridLocalizer class.</p><p>In this example, grand total headers ('Grand Total' by default) are replaced with 'Aggregate Total' strings, automatic total headers' patterns ('{0} Total' by default) are replaced with 'Total for {0}' strings, and the text displayed within the Filter Header Area ('Drop Filter Fields Here' by default) is replaced with 'Filter Header Area is currently empty' string. To do this, a PivotGridLocalizer class descendant (CustomDXPivotGridLocalizer) has been created, and its GetLocalizedString method has been overridden to replace the default strings.</p><br />
